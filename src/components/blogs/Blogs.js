            <h1>What is the purpose of react-router?</h1>
            <br />
            <p>Ans: React Router is an API for React applications. Most current code is written with React Router 3, although version 4 has been released. React Router uses dynamic routing.</p>

            <h1>How does context api works?</h1>
            <br />
            <p>Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.</p>
            <br />
            <h1>What is useRef?</h1>
            <br />
            <p>The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders. It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated. It can be used to access a DOM element directly.</p>
